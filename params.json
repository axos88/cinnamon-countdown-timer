  "body": "# Countdown Timer\r\n\r\nA simple countdown timer app, modeled after a kitchen timer. I wanted something easy to remind myself to get up every hour and stretch. To jazz it up a little the timer can play a sound, flash a message, open the applet menu, or plaster a confirmation dialog on the screen -- hard to miss. You can display several notifications at once, such as displaying the confirmation dialog while playing an alarm sound. The app defaults to just a message, the app menu being popped open, and a minutes countdown label on the panel. The label can be disabled in config.js\r\n\r\nTo set the sound, message, or confirm dialog edit the ~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/timer-notifications@markbokil.com/config.js file. You can right-click applet to edit the config file. Select right-click Restart Cinnamon to reload the applet after editing.\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\n0) Add sox play if you want sound capability: sudo apt-get install sox\r\n\r\n1) Extract to ~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets\r\n\r\n2) Enable the applet in cinnamon settings\r\n\r\n3) Restart Cinnamon if you change the config.js file. Right-click applet > Restart\r\n\r\n\r\n## TODO:\r\n  * Add GUI for options and save to gsettings schema avoiding config.js approach.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n* 2.0.0\r\n  - Forked code from original author\r\n  - Now displaying hours, minutes, seconds\r\n  - Slider has multiple with different (increasing) steps, to be able to easily pick any interval between 10 seconds and 24 hours.\r\n  - Streamlined UI: moved preset into main menu in order to be able to start the timer with two clicks\r\n  - refactored and cleaned out the code a bit\r\n  - presets and intervals for the slider can now be dynamically configured. \r\n* 1.0.2\r\n  - centered confirm dialog text\r\n  - added restart to right-click menu\r\n  - fixed 3 min preset error\r\n  - added panel label countdown\r\n* 1.0.1\r\n  - added run, stop, alarm states to icon, \r\n  - added 3 min. tea time\r\n  - centered dialog button with CSS\r\n  - tweaked slider code to reset icons timer/on off if dragged to zero\r\n  - added right-click edit menu.\r\n* 1.0.0\r\n  - stable release.\r\n\r\n> Forked from timer-notifications@markbokil.com: https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/68",
